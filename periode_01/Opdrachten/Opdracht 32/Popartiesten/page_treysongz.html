		<h2> Jeugd </h2>
			<p> Tremaine Aldon Neverson was born on November 28, 1984, in Petersburg, Virginia.[2] He is the son of April (Gholson) Tucker, who was seventeen when he was born, <br>
			and Claude Neverson Jr.[3] Raised as a military brat by his mother and stepfather,[4] Songz did not have aspirations for a musical career as a child due to his shyness,<br>
			 saying "Singing wasn't a reality for me, until other people started noticing I sounded good."[5] He recognized his vocal abilities at the age of 14.[5] Reluctant to sing,<br>
			 he began performing with encouragement by friends and family in high school. Record producer Troy Taylor was introduced to Songz through Songz step-father with whom Taylor attended High School,<br>
			 ultimately leading to Songz signing a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 2003.[6] <br>
			 After graduating from Petersburg High School in 2002, Songz moved to New Jersey to begin recording his debut album, though recording did not actually begin until 2003 </p>

		<h2> Zijn muziek </h2>			
			<p> Songz’s music is generally R&B, and occasionally displays his ability to blend with Hip-hop while still maintaining a production of songs that evoke emotions and vary in subject matters that revolve around the appreciation of women, stimulation of club rave-ups, expression of lust and chronicling the highs and lows of love and relationships.[1] Songz’s musical influences include Luther Vandross, Prince, R. Kelly and Usher.[44][45]
			The Grammy nominated Chapter V most notably demonstrates his versatility, vocal range, lyricism and melodic girth as he
			de that discusses trials and tribulations of love and heartache. “Ladies Go Wild” is a dance-friendly track that stems from his experiences of his
			international nightlife and travels. The “Hail Mary” track balances sensuality against grittiness and likens the pleasures of a woman to a ‘hail mary’ football throw, 
			while “Without A Woman” exemplifies his appreciation for women over a classic 1970s R&B sound. Moreover, “Check Me Out” effortlessly combines Trey’s rap flow and melodic skills, in extension to 
			“Dive In” which is considered to be his most signature-sounding record that uses suave wordplay to compare his pending conquest of a woman's body to taking a dive in the pool.
			Songz describes his albums as work “that will take you many places, emotionally and sensually. </p>
